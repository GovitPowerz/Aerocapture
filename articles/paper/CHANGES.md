# Changes since arxiv-v3

The committed `paper.pdf` is the arxiv-v3 build. The Typst source carries the changes below
for the next version; the PDF is recompiled only when that version pass is complete.

- 2026-09-16 (#108, ADR-0006): the abstract and the conclusion lead with the per-scenario-noise
  result (fine-tuned Mamba, CVaR99.9 163.2 +- 1.3 m/s over three seeds, 99.996% capture of 10^6,
  73 m/s below FNPAG and the best dense network) and state the shared-path result (123.3 +- 0.1 at
  100% capture) as the historical headline that Appendix E corrects. Sections 5-7 and their tables
  still quote the shared-path regime and say so; per-scenario re-quotes of those sections are not
  part of this change.
- 2026-09-22 (#101): Section 5's reinforcement-learning sentence is re-quoted from
  protocol-matched cells. The old sentence ("636 m/s mean for the dense PPO policy and 513 for
  the recurrent one", footnoted as predating simulator fixes) mislabelled its artifacts: both
  bundled legacy RL cells (`legacy/neural_network_rl`, `legacy/neural_network_gru_ppo`) are one
  Dense -> GRU(16) -> Dense architecture on a 21-input mask at 15M / 60M env steps, matched to no
  population cell. The new baseline (`experiments/paper/18_rl_baseline.sh`, configs under
  `configs/training/paper/rl/`) trains PPO from scratch and PPO warm-started from the per-scenario
  champions `ou_marginal/ft_dense_p515` and `ou_marginal/ft_gru_p1014` under their exact
  observation contract, scaffolding, per_draw regime and reserved pools; the quote reads the new
  `rl/*` and `ou_marginal/*` keys of `data/results.json` (2M pool, n = 1000, four `ppo_*` paired
  tables). The footnote is gone. The README results card gains the two dense PPO rows on the
  10^6 confirmatory pools (`experiments/ou_marginal/confirmatory_marginal.json`) and a
  contributions block; the review workflow artifacts moved from `articles/paper/` to
  `docs/paper/reviews/`.
